On "bing.com/create", you can describe an image with words and get an impression of artificial intelligence.
In this post, I will show you what I got from AI by saying each sentence.

Wooden cabin in the autumn forest.

A wooden cabin in an autumn forest with beautiful autumn colors.

And every time you give a repeated sentence to this AI, it will deliver you a series of new photos.
